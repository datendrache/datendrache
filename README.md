"I feel like Superman when I don't have supervision!" -- Datendrache

## What I'm trying to accomplish

Different ways of looking at the big picture:

1) I'm trying to build my own version of agentic AI, with an emphasis on achieving things only computers are capable of,
2) Create a monumentally large nervous system of inputs that can be scaled indefinitely without the cloud.
3) Reinvestigate some of the technologies we took for granted because they were first to market, and rebuild them to "final optimized form".
4) Having what some companies are paying millions of dollars for to cloud providers that are essentially free if people would just share the software.

## Why?

The fastest animal on earth is the Cheetah.
A human is about average in speed compared to all the animals on earth.
If you put a human on a bicycle, the human goes to the top of the list.
Humans are already the smartest animal,
But if you pair a human with a computer, you can get a more capable human.

But what does that even mean, "a more capable human"?
In my mind, the computer needs to do more on a personal level than they do
so that the person using it has the answers to questions, sometimes even before they realize they need it.
Patience, exploration, searching -- reading millions of documents daily
finding the people, places, and concepts that matter most.

I still can't tell a person what a Library is for because of too many results possible.
If a person seeks knowledge, they find a book and read it.
But if that knowledge isn't in a book they have to go elsewhere.
TL;DR? good. The world doesn't stop spinning for people, though.
So simply put, my goal is to make the tools that seek knowledge.

Chat AI capabilities speak when spoken to.
But I want to listen, and be told when to act.
All the while, MY computer friend will be vigilant and faithful
When other AIs may not.
